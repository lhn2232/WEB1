    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Remember those walls I built Well baby they`re tumbling down And they didn`t even put up a fight They didn`t even make a sound I found a way to let you in
    But I never really had a doubt
    Standing in the light of your halo
    I got my angel now
    It's like I`ve been awakened
    Every rule I had you breakin`
    It`s the risk that I'm takin`
    I ain`t never gonna shut you out
    Everywhere I`m looking now
    I`m surrounded by your embrace</p>
    Baby I can see your halo
    You know you`re my saving grace
    You`re everything I need and more
    It`s written all over your face
    Baby I can feel your halo
    Pray it won`t fade away
